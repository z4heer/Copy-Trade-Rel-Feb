\# Copy Trading App â€” Windows Installable User Guide

This guide explains how to build, bundle, and run the Copy Trading App as a single Windows executable (with Angular frontend and Python backend via PyInstaller).

\---

\#\# 1\. Build the Angular Frontend

1\. Open a command prompt and navigate to the frontend directory:  
    \`\`\`bat  
    cd frontend\\copy-trading-v2-app  
    \`\`\`

2\. Install dependencies (only once or after updating \`package.json\`):  
    \`\`\`bat  
    npm install  
    \`\`\`

3\. Build the Angular app:  
    \`\`\`bat  
    ng build  
    \`\`\`  
    \- This creates the production build inside:  
      \`\`\`  
      dist\\copy-trading-v2-app\\browser\\  
      \`\`\`

\---

\#\# 2\. Prepare the Backend Static Folder

1\. Copy the entire contents of the Angular build output into the backend's static folder:  
    \`\`\`bat  
    xcopy /E /I /Y dist\\copy-trading-v2-app\\browser\\\* ..\\..\\backend\\static\\  
    \`\`\`  
    \- \`backend\\static\\\` should now contain \`index.html\`, JS, CSS, \`favicon.ico\`, etc.

\---

\#\# 3\. Ensure Configuration and Data Files Are Present

\- Make sure your \`backend\\conf\\\` folder contains all needed config/data files (e.g., \`users.xls\`, \`settings.ini\`).

Example structure:  
\`\`\`  
backend\\  
  app.py  
  utils.py  
  conf\\  
    users.xls  
    settings.ini  
  static\\  
    index.html  
    favicon.ico  
    (Angular build assets)  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\# 4\. Build the Standalone Executable with PyInstaller

\- In the \`backend\` directory, clean previous builds:  
    \`\`\`bat  
    rmdir /s /q build dist \_\_pycache\_\_  
    del app.spec  
    \`\`\`

\- Run PyInstaller (Windows syntax for \--add-data uses a semicolon \`;\`):  
    \`\`\`bat  
    pyinstaller \--onefile \--add-data "conf;conf" \--add-data "static;static" app.py  
    \`\`\`

\- After successful build, find your executable in the \`dist\\\` folder (e.g., \`dist\\app.exe\`).

\---

\#\# 5\. How to Use the Installable

1\. Copy the executable (\`dist\\app.exe\`) to your desired location on the user's machine.

2\. Double-click \`app.exe\` to start the app. A command window will open and stay running.

3\. Open a web browser and go to:  
    \`\`\`  
    http://localhost:5000/  
    \`\`\`  
    \- The Angular app will appear and all backend functionality is available.

\---

\#\# 6\. Notes & Troubleshooting

\- If you update the frontend, always re-copy the build files into \`backend\\static\\\` and rebuild the executable.  
\- Always use the provided \`resource\_path()\` helper in the backend to load config/data files for compatibility with both development and bundled modes.  
\- If you see 404 errors for \`/\`, \`/favicon.ico\`, or static files, check that \`static\\\` contains the correct Angular build files.  
\- If you see errors about missing config/data files, ensure they are bundled via the \`--add-data\` flag and accessed using the resource path helper.  
\- If you need to update \`conf\` or \`static\`, always rebuild the executable after making changes.

\---

\#\# 7\. Troubleshooting Checklist

\- \[ \] Angular build files are present in \`backend\\static\\\` (including \`index.html\`)  
\- \[ \] Config/data files are present in \`backend\\conf\\\`  
\- \[ \] PyInstaller command includes both \`--add-data "conf;conf"\` and \`--add-data "static;static"\`  
\- \[ \] All files are accessed using the \`resource\_path()\` helper in Python  
\- \[ \] Rebuilt the executable after every change to \`conf\\\` or \`static\\\`
