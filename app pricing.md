## Factors Influencing Price

   - Custom design, responsiveness, accessibility, etc.

3. **Testing & Documentation:**  
   - Code quality, automated tests, user guides, API docs.

4. **Intellectual Property & Usage Rights:**  
   - Is the client getting full source code and rights?  
   - Are you retaining resale rights?

5. **Support & Warranty:**  
   - Any post-delivery support or bug fixing included?

6. **Market & Client Type:**  
   - Is the client a startup, SME, or large enterprise?

## Typical Indian Freelance/Small Agency Pricing (2024-2025)

- **3 months part-time** (assume ~15-20 hours/week, total ~180-240 hours)
- **Hourly rate (India, experienced developer):** ₹600–₹2,500/hr ($7–$30/hr)

### **Estimated Price Calculation**

- **Low End:** 180h × ₹600/hr = ₹1,08,000 (~$1,300 USD)
- **High End:** 240h × ₹2,500/hr = ₹6,00,000 (~$7,200 USD)
- **Common Range for a Product:** ₹1,50,000 – ₹4,00,000 ($1,800 – $5,000 USD)

## **Market Realities**
- For a basic MVP: **₹1,00,000 – ₹2,00,000**
- For a solid, production-ready app: **₹2,00,000 – ₹5,00,000**
- For feature-rich or enterprise-grade: **₹5,00,000+**

## **How to Decide for Your Case**
- **Minimum:** Do not price below your effective hourly rate × hours spent.
- **Benchmark:** Compare with similar products on platforms like Upwork, Toptal, etc.
- **Value Pricing:** If app solves a critical pain point, can price higher.
- **Client Willingness:** Enterprise clients pay more than individuals or small startups.

**Best Practice:**  
Present a tiered quote (basic/standard/premium) and clarify what’s included (number of features, support, warranty, source code rights, etc.).

If you provide more details about the app’s features and target market, I can help you fine-tune the price further!
